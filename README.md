This repository contains the code and steps you can take to build a low-cost, potentially self-powered, basic security system that uses machine learning to detect people in the field of view of the camera lens.  
  
When someone is detected, the camera will turn the flash on, take a photo and save it to the local SD card and also send a WiFi notification via Blynk to alert you that someone is in your property or more etc.  
  
This repository is also a great learning curve for people interested in a project to get started in the microcontroller space, which you can find more of [here!](https://github.com/tristanfivaz/Our-Living-Lab)  

Navigate to the [Wiki](https://github.com/tristanfivaz/ESP32-Cam-Home-Security/wiki/1:-Introduction) tab to start learning how to apply this project.  

Please keep in mind I am self taught so do not rely on this system solely as the accuracy could change depending on circumstance.  
  
All other appropriate updates and listings about this repository will be included here.
